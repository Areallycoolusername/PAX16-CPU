# PAX16-CPU
The PAX16 Computer, is a computer that uses the PAX processor, which uses the Romanesco esolang as its native machine language. I am by no means an expert on FPGAs, so any advice is appreciated. This computer is based on the [CPU made by Clifford Wolf that uses Brainfuck as machine code](http://www.clifford.at/bfcpu/bfcpu.html).
# Etymology 
The name "PAX" is of arbitrary origin, however the 16 at the end, represents how the CPU is 16-bit. 
# Specifics
This computer is currently in the initial processor design stages, and, when ready, will be  implemented with an FPGA. This repo will not feature the file used to create the computer, (to prevent plagirism), but will feature example Romanesco files that were made to run exclusively on the PAX16 CPU.
# Romanesco
Romanesco is the project name of the PAX machine language. It is supposed to run using "fractured" programs, a new program form devised by me. As this repo will only feature Romanesco files, the official documentation will be featured in a seperate repo.
