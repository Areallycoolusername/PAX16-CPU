# PAX16-CPU
The PAX16 Computer, is a computer that uses the PAX processor, which uses the Romanesco esolang as its native assembly. This computer is currently in the initial processor design stages, and, when ready, will be  implemented with an FPGA. This repo will not feature the file used to create the computer, (to prevent plagirism), but will feature example Romanesco files that were made to run exclusively on the PAX16 CPU. 
# Etymology 
The name "PAX" is of arbitrary origin, however the 16 at the end, represents how the CPU is 16-bit.
